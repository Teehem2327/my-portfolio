# 🎅 Secret Santa Matching App - Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline 🚀

This project showcases a complete CI/CD pipeline built from scratch for a Java-based Secret Santa Matching App using Jenkins, Docker, SonarQube, and OWASP Dependency Check. The pipeline is hosted on an EC2 instance and follows DevSecOps best practices with secure, automated delivery.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build a secure, automated CI/CD pipeline for a Java web application using Jenkins (on EC2), integrating code quality analysis, security scanning, containerization, and DockerHub deployment.
