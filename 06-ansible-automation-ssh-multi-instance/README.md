# Project 06: Automating Multi-Instance Tasks with Ansible & SSH

## üìå Objective

This project documents my first hands-on automation tasks using **Ansible**, the powerful open-source configuration management tool. It demonstrates how I set up SSH key-based connections across multiple AWS EC2 instances, ran ad-hoc Ansible commands, explored dynamic inventories, and learned how to build reusable Playbooks and Roles.

## üóÇÔ∏è Overview

Automation and configuration management are key DevOps skills. This project shows how Ansible can automate tasks across multiple servers without requiring agents ‚Äî using only SSH. It also highlights troubleshooting a real SSH session challenge and explains the difference between ad-hoc commands and structured automation with Playbooks and Roles.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **Ansible:** Agentless configuration management & automation
- **AWS EC2:** Cloud servers for practice nodes
- **SSH & ssh-keygen:** Secure communication and key-based authentication
- **Ansible Inventory:** Defined target hosts dynamically
- **Ansible Playbooks & Roles:** Structured, reusable automation

## ‚úÖ Steps Performed

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Understood Ansible vs Puppet**
   - **Ansible:** Push-based, agentless (uses SSH)
   - **Puppet:** Pull-based, agent-based, master-slave architecture

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Generated SSH Keys & Connected**
   - Created key pairs with `ssh-keygen`
   - Configured SSH access to connect from one EC2 instance to another securely

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Created Ansible Inventory**
   - Wrote a simple `inventory` file listing the target instance IPs

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Ran Ad-Hoc Ansible Commands**
   - Verified Ansible setup with:
     ```bash
     ansible -i inventory all -m shell -a "touch DevOpsclass"
     ```
   - Confirmed file creation on target nodes

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Explored Playbooks & Roles**
   - Started moving from ad-hoc commands to structured Playbooks
   - Used `ansible-galaxy` to initialize a role:
     ```bash
     ansible-galaxy role init kubernetes
     ```
   - Learned how roles help organize tasks for reuse and teamwork

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Real SSH Challenge**
   - Faced a common real-world issue: when SSHing from the primary instance to the target with a private IP, the terminal session was taken over.
   - Solved it by opening a new terminal window to run Ansible commands while keeping the target SSH session separate.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Ansible Concepts Practiced

‚úÖ **Agentless Automation:** No need to install agents on target nodes  
‚úÖ **Dynamic Inventory:** Real-time infrastructure management  
‚úÖ **Ad-Hoc Commands vs Playbooks:** Quick tasks vs structured automation  
‚úÖ **Roles:** Reusable, modular configurations  
‚úÖ **SSH Best Practices:** Secure, efficient remote execution

## üéØ Result

‚úÖ Successfully automated tasks across multiple EC2 instances  
‚úÖ Secured connections with SSH key-based auth  
‚úÖ Practiced real-time troubleshooting of session conflicts  
‚úÖ Understood how to scale from ad-hoc to Playbooks & Roles

## üöÄ Next Steps

- Write and run full Playbooks to install packages, manage services, and configure nodes  
- Use dynamic inventory plugins for auto-registering cloud resources  
- Integrate Ansible with Jenkins for automated CI/CD pipelines  
- Build robust role libraries for common tasks (e.g., LAMP stack, Kubernetes cluster)
