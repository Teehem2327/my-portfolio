# Project 19: GCP Hands-On — My First Steps into Google Cloud Platform

## 📌 Objective

This project marks my **multi-cloud journey**, showcasing my first practical steps with **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** after gaining strong hands-on skills in AWS. Here I explored GCP fundamentals, built real services, and deepened my understanding of how different cloud providers operate.

## 🗂️ Project Overview

**What I achieved:**

| Service | Hands-On Tasks |
|---------|----------------|
| **GCP Fundamentals** | Learned IAM, billing, and global infrastructure basics |
| **Cloud Shell** | Used browser-based CLI for provisioning resources |
| **VPC Network** | Created Virtual Private Cloud networks |
| **Firewall Rules** | Configured inbound/outbound firewall rules |
| **VPC Peering** | Connected multiple VPCs securely |
| **App Engine** | Deployed my first app using fully managed PaaS |
| **Cloud Run** | Deployed containerized app in a serverless way |

## 🗃️ Key Tools & Services

✅ **Cloud Shell:** GCP’s browser terminal for fast provisioning  
✅ **VPC:** Private networking layer for GCP resources  
✅ **Firewall Rules:** Secure networking with custom ingress/egress  
✅ **VPC Peering:** Seamless cross-VPC communication  
✅ **App Engine:** Managed application platform (PaaS)  
✅ **Cloud Run:** Serverless container execution

## 💡 What I Learned

- **Cloud parity:** VPCs and IAM in GCP vs AWS — similarities and differences
- **Serverless deployment:** App Engine vs AWS Lambda
- **Containerized workloads:** Cloud Run vs AWS Fargate
- **Multi-cloud mindset:** Building transferable cloud skills
