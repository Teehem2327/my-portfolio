# Project 04: Version Control with Git & GitHub

## 📌 Objective

This project documents my hands-on practice with Git and GitHub — fundamental tools for version control, collaboration, and modern DevOps workflows. I explored key concepts, understood distributed vs centralized VCS, and practiced core Git commands for real-world software development.

## 🗂️ Overview

Version control is vital for any developer or DevOps engineer. Git allows multiple people to work on the same codebase without conflict, while GitHub adds a cloud-based platform for collaboration, code review, and project management.

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools

- **Git:** Distributed Version Control System
- **GitHub:** Cloud-based platform for code hosting & collaboration
- **Key Concepts:** Branching, cloning, forking, merging, rebasing, commits, pull requests

## ✅ Steps Performed

1️⃣ **Understood Version Control Systems (VCS)**  
   - Centralized VCS: CVS, SVN (single repository, network dependent)  
   - Distributed VCS: Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket (local copy on every developer’s machine, resilient, works offline)

2️⃣ **Explored Git vs GitHub**  
   - Git: Tracks and manages code changes  
   - GitHub: Adds collaboration, issue tracking, wikis, pull requests, access control, CI/CD integrations

3️⃣ **Practiced Essential Git Commands**
   - `git init` — Initialize a new local repo
   - `git add` — Stage changes
   - `git commit -m "msg"` — Commit staged changes
   - `git diff` — Compare changes
   - `git status` — Show file status
   - `git log` — View commit history
   - `git log --oneline` — View concise commit history
   - `git pull` — Fetch & merge from remote
   - `git push` — Push local commits to remote
   - `git clone` — Copy remote repo locally
   - `git checkout -b branch-name` — Create and switch branches
   - `git branch` — List branches
   - `git merge` — Merge branches
   - `git rebase` — Reapply commits on top of another base
   - `git cherry-pick` — Apply specific commits from another branch
   - `git reset --hard` — Reset working directory & index to previous commit

4️⃣ **Learned Branching Strategies**
   - **Main/Master:** Primary branch
   - **Feature Branches:** For building features independently
   - **Release Branches:** Prepare code for production
   - **Hotfix Branches:** Quick fixes for production bugs

5️⃣ **Practiced Clone vs Fork**
   - **Clone:** Copy a remote repo to local machine
   - **Fork:** Create a separate copy under your GitHub account for independent changes

6️⃣ **Merge vs Rebase**
   - **Merge:** Combine histories; can result in more complex logs
   - **Rebase:** Cleaner linear history by reapplying commits in order

- Pushing to GitHub

## 🎯 Result

✅ Understood key version control concepts  
✅ Practiced daily Git commands and workflows  
✅ Learned how to manage branches and collaborate with GitHub  
✅ Gained confidence using Git logs, diffs, and conflict resolution basics

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Contribute to open-source projects via forks and pull requests
- Practice advanced Git workflows (e.g., squash merges, interactive rebases)
- Automate GitHub actions for CI/CD
- Explore project boards and issue tracking for agile project management
